Service Workers are a feature from more modern browsers, meaning implementing them into our website is 
a move that prioritizes users with newer browsers, and thus uses newer technology. They also help save
important information ahead of time, so you can run your app offline. This ties into graceful degradation,
since even with the network down, we can fall back on service workers. However, they're a newer feature, so 
starting off with them mimicks the graceful degradation strategy
